The `@tool` decorator from LangChain converts this function into a tool that the agent can use. Notice how we include a detailed docstring - this is crucial as the agent uses this information to understand when and how to use the tool.\n",
    "2. The `information_retriever` tool looks up solutions in our knowledge base. The return_direct=True parameter is important here - it tells the agent to return the result directly to the user without further processing, which is perfect for our final solution steps.\n",
